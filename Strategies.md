  - [My recommended exam prep strategy](#my-recommended-exam-prep-strategy)
  - [How to access the free online resources](#how-to-access-the-free-online-resources)
  - [PDFs downloads of video content](#pdfs-downloads-of-video-content)

## My recommended exam prep strategy

Reading the entire [Comptia Security+ Study Guide](https://amzn.to/3N6Pwe3) cover-to-cover is not an effective exam preparation strategy. There is a tremendous amount of information in more than a thousand pages. You will almost certainly forget more than you remember in a single pass. 

A proven, time-efficient and effective strategy involves:

- Identifying your weak areas
- Focusing your reading on weak topics
- Using a variety of resources (video, quizzes, flashcards, reading)
- Reviewing content multiple times (called "spaced repetition")

The details of this strategy are covered in the Security+ Exam Cram Intro and Strategy video [HERE](https://youtu.be/UnPlkq2waKU)

## How to access the free online resources

I receive a lot of questions about how to access the free online resources that come with the [Official CISSP Exam Study Guide](https://amzn.to/3qb6z5H), which are an important part of my recommended exam preparation strategy. 

To help, I created a video tutorial that walks you through the registration process for these resources. For assistance, watch [How to register for online resources in CISSP Official Study Guide](https://youtu.be/iJbvuWVJq4s).

## PDFs downloads of video content

The PDF downloads of the video content can be very useful in quizzing yourself with a partner.

The latest info on where to download the PDFs is available [HERE](Downloads.md)
