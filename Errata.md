## XSRF/CSRF definition 

[Timestamp: 47:46](https://youtu.be/9Hd8QJmZQUc?t=2866)

Cross-site request forgery takes advantage of the trust that a web application, but in the video is misstated "trust user has in a website".

 You will also see this sometimes stated as "trust a website has for your browser", but "trust a website has in a user" is how that should be stated, not the other way around.

## Color-coding in Shared Responsibility legend 

[Timestamp: 01:38:00](https://youtu.be/9Hd8QJmZQUc?t=5880)

The Shared Responsibility diagram IS CORRECT. 

Color-coding in the legend below the "Shared Responsbility Model" is reversed.

In the video:
