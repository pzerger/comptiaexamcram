### What score on practice quizzes is good enough? 

The score required to pass the exam is 70%, and the questions on the actual exam are more difficult than those on the practice quiz. For that reason, I would suggest completing all the questions at the end of each chapter, aiming for a score of 85-90%. 

After each quiz, read the explanations of the questions you miss and do some targeted reading on those specific topics from the official study guide. Repeat the process until your practice quiz results meet the 85-90% bar. This is the "80/20 strategy" I explain in the video.

### Can I access online practice quizzes if I purchased the Kindle version?

Yes you can! The instructions are INDENTICAL (exactly the same) for EVERY e-book platform. Anyone who says "no" is simply not following the instructions in the Sybex book. See the FAQ regarding registration and access to the online resources.
