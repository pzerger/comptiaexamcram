**NOTE ON PRACTICE QUIZZES:** I think the practices quizzes that come with the Official Security+ Study Guide are all you need prepare for the exam. However, if you want more, I am a fan of [Pocket Prep](https://www.pocketprep.com/exams/comptia-security/?ref=peterzerger) for their mobile experience, per-domain scoring, answer explanations, re-take options, and small price tag. More info [HERE](https://www.pocketprep.com/exams/comptia-security/?ref=peterzerger)

There are also some free Security+ Practice Questions available from Comptia [HERE](https://bit.ly/2SZ79m0)

## WEEK 4 (DOMAIN 4) - June 1st, 2022

Since domain 4 includes a long list of security tools, I want you to do some quick hands-on testing as you watch the video. Details below.

**IMPORTANT**: If you do not have a Linux VM, install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (click for how-to)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and access it using [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install).

1. **VIDEO and LAB**. Watch [DOMAIN 4](https://youtu.be/9Hd8QJmZQUc?t=28872) from my updated Security+ Exam Cram series. Anytime you see me talk about a tool you are not familiar with, pause the video, and try the tool from a Windows or Linux command prompt using the example I shared when possible.

2. **PRACTICE QUIZ**. Take the domain 4 practice quiz from the online resources for the CompTIA Security+ Practice Tests (see Figure 1 below). Set it for the number of questions you have time for, but try to take 100 questions from domain 3 over the course over the week. Review explanations of wrong answers. Record your score.

3. **READING AND PDF**. Do some reading from the Official Study Guide on your weak topics from the practice quiz. If it helps, review the [Domain 4 Slides (pdf)](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmhtzcmYt5AViPciEOaHzZgJUfaUwQ?e=AkeaF8) as well.
