## WEEK 1 (DOMAIN 1) - May 11th, 2022

Homework for week 1 is: 

1.	Take a practice quiz of Domain 1 questions (chapters 1-4). Review explanations of wrong answers. Record your score.
3.	Take the free Security+ practice questions available from Comptia [HERE](https://bit.ly/2SZ79m0).

**SESSION REPLAY:** Video available [HERE](https://youtu.be/WH6cBbEqn5w)

**NOTE ON PRACTICE QUIZZES:** I think the practices quizzes that come with the Official Security+ Study Guide are all you need prepare for the exam. However, if you want more, I am a fan of [Pocket Prep](https://www.pocketprep.com/exams/comptia-security/?ref=peterzerger) for their mobile experience, per-domain scoring, answer explanations, re-take options, and small price tag.

There are also some free Security+ Practice Questions available from Comptia [HERE](https://bit.ly/2SZ79m0)
